    <h2>Egg Salad can be a dream!</h2>
    <p>Some people don't think you can liven up an egg salad 
        but I'm here to tell you they are wrong. First, we must 
    start with the basics. Everyone knows an egg salad needs 
    mayonnaise. There's no doubt about it. Then mustard. Next, 
    things really get spicy with the spices!! This is one of the
    most special parts of the recipe. I like to add salt, pepper, 
    paprika, dill, garlic powder, and for a hint of home, some 
    curry powder. Spices aren't the only special parts of this 
    recipe.</p>
    <p>To take your egg salad to the next level, you'll want to 
        diced onion into the egg mixture. Yellow or green onion
        are my preferences. Then serve the salad on a bed of 
        spinach on wheat toast. To top it all off, slice grape
        tomatoes and face them down on the egg. Now, go ENJOY!
