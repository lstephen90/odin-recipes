    <h2>This melt will make you want to melt!</h2>

    <p>For many, Tuna Melts don't come to mind first for dinner. In my
        family the tuna melt was a comfort food. The right amount of
        spices and mayonnaise and you'll find yourself among the clouds 
        in heaven. If you are really into cheese pulls then this is the 
        sandwich for you. Get ready to cozy up on the couch, enjoy your
        homemade goodness and watch your favorite show on a rainy day.

                <li>Cheddar</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Open your can of tuna leaving a small hinge so that it is still
            attached to the rest of the can. Squeeze out as much water as 
            you can. Then use a fork or knife to pry the lid open again.
        </li>
        <li>Mix the mayonnaise, mustard, onion, garlic and spices together.</li>
        <li>The pour in your tuna. Mix well. Make sure it is to your taste.</li>
        <li>Put butter on one side of two slices of bread.</li>
        <li>Put your tuna mixture on one side of the bread. Lay a slice or 
            two of your preferred cheese on top. Put the other side of the 
            bread on top with the butter side facing inwards.
        </li>
        <li>Turn on the burner under your frying pan.</li>
        <li>While the pan heats, spread mayonnaise on the top of the sandwich.
            Be generous and cover evenly.
        </li>
        <li>Once the pan is hot, use a spatula to carefully flip the sandwich
            into the pan on the side with the mayonnaise.
        </li>
        <li>Let the bottom of the sandwich cook for 2-3 minutes or until golden
            brown on the bottom. While it cooks put mayonnaise on the now top
            of the sandwich. Once the underside is golden and crispy, flip the 
            sandwich over so the other side can cook. Fry until golden.
        </li>
        <li>Once you have a golden sandwich and the cheese appears to be melted,
            remove the sandwich from the pan. Put on a plate. Slice diagonally.
            Serve immediately with Lays or Doritos chips. Enjoy!
        </li>
